                    <h4 class="text-left">Project Overview</h4>
                    <p class="text-left">     
                        Dengue, Malaria and Zika are vector-borne diseases
                        caused by mosquitoes that carry the parasites that lead to
                        illnesses. According to the World Health Organization (WHO)
                        hundreds of thousands of people around the world die every year
                        due to disease-transmitting mosquitoes. Mosquito outbreaks
                        occur most commonly in warm climates, in areas close to the
                        equator and tropical regions. Female mosquitoes lay their eggs in
                        the ponds and puddles where water accumulates due to rainfall.
                        In 2016, there was a significant spike in the number of dengue
                        cases in Argentina; there were 79,455 cases of dengue reported
                        in 2016 compared to 3250 cases in 2014 and 4774 in 2015 and
                        went back down to the hundreds in 2017 and rose to thousands
                        again in 2018. Since Dengue and Zika are spread by the same
                        species of mosquito, Aedes aegypti, the goal of this project is to
                        examine whether the spike in dengue cases in 2016 in Argentina
                        also led to a spike in Zika cases.
                        During this study we will determine if there is a correlation
                        between the number of Zika cases and rainfall precipitation
                        levels. For the analysis, we use available Zika data for Argentina
                        obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                        (CDC) database. More specifically, we are looking at the
                        number of cases per month at a county level in Argentina. The
                        precipitation data is obtained from the National Aeronautics and
                        Space Administration (NASA) through the Global Precipitation
                        Measurement Mission (GPM). Just like the Zika data,
                        precipitation data is also on a monthly basis and data is available
                        at a county level.
                        There are existing systems for forecasting the outbreak of
                        vector-borne diseases in various countries and each system looks
                        at a particular factor. For example, the Dengue forecasting
                        MOdel Satellite-based System (D-MOSS) is a system that issues
                        warnings of dengue outbreaks eight months before outbreaks are
                        likely to occur in Vietnam. Another existing early warning
                        system is the Predictive fLUshing Mosquito (PLUM) model.
                        PLUM was developed by Draper Scientists in collaboration with
                        scientists from Boston University and the Massachusetts Institute
                        of Technology (MIT) to help predict and decrease outbreaks of
                        dengue fever using observations collected in Singapore, Peru, and
                        Puerto Rico.
                        Our work is inspired by D-MOSS, but instead of including
                        water availability as a component in the prediction and focusing
                        on Vietnam, we are interested in finding out the relationship
                        between Zika outbreaks and precipitation levels in Argentina.
                        The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations aim
                        to address global problems of peace, justice, gender equality, good
                        health and many others. Similar to how D-MOSS targets these
                        UN Sustainability goals, our project aspires to bring a similar
                        approach when dealing with the Zika Virus. We will produce a
                        report of our analysis results and visualizations that can be used
                        by beneficiaries in Argentina to help in the efforts of combating
                        and controlling the spread of Zika virus.

                    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                    <h4> Precipitation Data:</h4>
                    <p>  <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/main/index.html">Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission</a>  of
                        NASA aims to collect reliable rainfall and snow (precipitation) information,
                        recorded every three hours and combined together. The
                        recorded data is made freely available in HDF5 format. We
                        subset the data using a bounding box around Argentina and
                        collect the final run data from January, 2016 to December,
                        2017. A total of 24 data files were collected, each corresponding
                        to a specific month and year.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Zika Data:</h4>

                    <p>
                        The Zika data is compiled from integrated surveillance
                        bulletins from Argentina’s Ministry of Health. The data was
                        provided in CSV file format for each bulletin, which were
                        issued irregularly throughout a month and included the number
                        of Zika cases in each province since the last bulletin. Since our
                        precipitation data was grouped by month, we used a python
                        script to aggregate the Zika data into a monthly granularity.    
                   </p>

                        <h3> Project Workflow  </h3>

                        <p>
                            The project workflow as shown in Figure 1, project starts with
                            obtaining the data from the sources, cleaning the data, and
                            storing the data on a local repository. We then plan to perform 
                            analysis by creating models and visualizations that will help
                            us determine whether the increase in Dengue cases in 2016
                            also led to the increase in Zika cases and help us determine the
                            correlation between the number of Zika cases and precipitation
                            levels. We will produce a final report that will include our
                            analysis results and visualizations. Then as a final step, we
                            will archive the project on GitHub.

                    <p>
                        From Figure 2 shown below, it is seen that the highest precipitation levels
                        occur in the upper north-eastern region of Argentina where as the rest of the
                         country had relatively low rates of precipitation.
                        However, this region does not correspond with the highest
                        numbers of Zika cases, which is seen in the north-western
                        region of Argentina as well as on central eastern border of the
                        country.

                    <p> 
                        Figure 3 shown below shows a spread of comparatively higher precipitation
                        levels across the middle of Argentina which fades
                        towards the eastern and western regions of the country, with
                        the western region having the lowest amounts of precipitation.
                        The number of Zika cases are relatively low and only exist in
                        a few provinces.
                        Comparing Figures 2 and 3 the amount of precipitation is
                        lower for March 2016 than March 2017 but there are a larger
                        number of Zika cases for March 2016 than 2017 and they are
                        spread throughout the entire country where as for March 2017
                        the cases are sparsely spread across the northern and eastern
                        parts of the country.

                        valuable insights can be gained and used for prevention
                        planning. It will also provide context as to how climate change
                        can affect mosquito breeding trends and thus vector-borne
                        diseases. A direct correlation between the average rainfall
                        spread and the Zika cases of the same month do not align well
                        with one another but a delayed correlation has high probability
                        due to the nature of Zika spread.
