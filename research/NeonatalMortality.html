                    <h4 class="text-left">Project Overview</h4>
                    <p class="text-left">     
                        The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a
                        set of targets that the UN hopes all countries will reach by
                        2030 broadly spanning the range of health, education, racial
                        inequalities, environmental protections, and several other fields.
                        Among these goals includes (Goal 3.2) an aim for all countries
                        to reduce Neonatal Mortality Rates (NMR) to 12 per 1,000 live
                        births. Without properly allocating resources to see the most
                        dramatic shifts in NMR, many countries may be at risk of not
                        meeting these ambitious goals. However, there are many factors
                        which may influence national NMR, and while much previous
                        work has been done to identify factors that influence NMR
                        usually on a nation by nation basis, these factors can tend to
                        vary. The goal of this study is to find factors that consistently
                        lead, by changing them, to a change in NMR for many countries,
                        in order to better inform health policy and resource allocations
                        to the medical sector.
                        This study will serve as an exploratory data analysis step
                        for future studies regarding the impact of several health indicators on NMR per country. 
                        Cross-sectional data from the year
                        2014 were used for this Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). To
                        identify indicators that showed significant differences between
                        the countries with high NMR and countries with low NMR,
                        Mann-Whitney U Tests were performed. The p-value for each
                        mean comparison was less than the 0.01 significance level. We
                        have built a K-means clustering model to observe the variables’
                        contribution to NMR, as well as a K-means clustering model to
                        observe the same data’s contributions to Gross Domestic Product
                        (GDP), to see if both NMR and GDP follow similar trends across
                        our target countries. The clustering for NMR groups of countries
                        showed mostly separate clusters, while the clustering for the same
                        data for the GDP classes showed very little separation, as the
                        most points from each class all occupied the same cluster. To
                        determine the actual amount that each indicator contributed to
                        the data, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to
                        understand the strongest contributions to the total data variance.
                        The results of this study will serve to highlight the most important
                        areas which must be improved in order to fulfill the Sustainable
                        Development Goals (SDG) by the end of the next decade and
                        to contribute to future studies that utilize longitudinal or more
                        recent data.

                    <h3>Data Acquisition for the project</h3>
                    
                    The data used for this study had three primary sources: the
                    World Health Organization (WHO) <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho">Global Health observatory
                        (ANC, IB, SHP)</a> , the <a href="https://data.unicef.org/dv_index/">UNICEF Data Warehouse (NMR, WAT,
                            SANI, LBW)</a>  , and the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD"> World Bank (GDP)</a> . All data used for
                    this study is publicly available.

                        <h3> Exploratory Data Analytics  </h3>

                        <p>
                            the primary purpose of these EDA
                        are to identify target indicators for future studies among those
                        suggested from literature. To determine differences, we first
                        use the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test to calculate the
                        p-value comparing the means of individual indicators between
                        countries of high and low NMR. In order to demonstrate
                        separability of the data, we use K-Means Clustering to attempt
                        to sort the data into two different categories based on their
                        indicators, and PCA to measure the most relevant variables in
                        explaining the NMR data.

                        </p>

                        <h3> Cluster Analysis  </h3>  

                    <p>
                        We use a combination of K-means clustering and Principal
                        Component Analysis (PCA) to describe differences in the data
                        for multiple indicators simultaneously. K-means clustering will
                        divide the high-dimensional data into partitions described by
                        a center point which is separate from all other center points
                        . For the purpose of assessing the quality of the clustering,
                        we are defining the clustering efficacy for K-means as the
                        percentage of countries which were computed to be within a
                        cluster where the majority of that group has been classified.
                        This can be regarded as the amount of separation between the
                        clusters, as we assume that greater separability in clusters (less
                        overlap) implies that the trends in the data more accurately
                        classify countries as higher or lower NMR. In this regard,
                        complete separability would indicate that the factors used
                        as dimensions are good estimators of the label groupings.
                        K-means clustering was performed for the two groups of
                        NMR: above and below the SDG threshold, as well as for the
                        four GDP classes: lower, lower mid, upper mid, and upper.
                        Principal Component Analysis was also performed on both
                        clusters to explain the indicators which contribute to the largest
                        share of variance in the NMR data, and to provide revealing
                        visualization of the clusters which will be explored in the
                        results section.

                    <h4> Clustering on Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR)  </h4>

                    <p> 
                        The data for 31 countries was available for all 7 of the
                        indicators we used. Indicators we explored are: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low Birth Weight (LBW)</li>
                            <li>Sanitation (SANI)</li>
                            <li>Access to basic water (WAT)</li>
                            <li>Institutional Births (IB)</li>
                            <li>Skilled Health Personnel at birth (SHP)</li>
                            <li>Anteatal care Coverage (ANC)</li>
                            <li>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</li>
                            

                        </ul>
                        
                        Among those countries, two clusters with high NMR
                        and 1 with low NMR were computed in the cluster predominantly occupied by the other group’s countries (misclassified),
                        resulting in a clustering efficacy of 90.3%. Fig. 1 shows these
                        clusters.  .

                    <p>
                        To determine the most relevant variables on the data, we
                        performed PCA for the 7 indicators, resulting in as many
                        principal components. Our first two principal components
                        represent most of the data, accounting for a cumulative 83.4%
                        of variance. Fig. 2 shows the contributions of the individual
                        indicators to these important principal components, compared
                        to the expected contribution. From this, we have 5 indicators
                        with contributions above the expected for these components:
                        Low Birth Weight (LBW), access to basic
                        water (WAT), Sanitation (SANI), Institutional Births (IB), and Skilled
                        Health Personnel at birth (SHP). A secondary clustering model
                        was formed using these countries in order to determine if
                        more data could potentially be included with minimal loss
                        in clustering efficacy.

                        Data for the remaining 5 indicators was available for 49
                        countries: 21 of high NMR and 28 of low NMR. All 28 of
                        the low NMR countries were clustered together, and 16 of the
                        high NMR countries were in the other cluster, resulting in a
                        clustering efficacy of 89.8%. For a relatively small decrease
                        in efficacy, we are able to obtain data for 18 more countries
                        with this simplified data model. Fig. 3. shows these clusters.

                    <h4>Clustering on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h4>

                    <p>
                        The same data for the same 49 countries was labelled
                        again for GDP data, this time corresponding to the four GDP
                        classes: low (less than $1,045 million) lower middle (between
                        $1,045 and $4,125 million), upper middle (between $4,125
                        and $12,746 million) and upper (greater than $12,746 million).
                        This clustering model showed that the majority of the countries
                        for all 4 GDP classes were in the same cluster, resulting in a
                        low clustering efficacy.

                    <p>
                        During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we have determined that the model containing the 5 indicators that contribute most to the principal
                        components which have the highest cumulative proportion of
                        variance for the model is not significantly worse than the
                        model which uses the comprehensive data, while also allowing
                        us to use data for 18 more countries: up to 49 from 31. We
                        Fig. 1. PCA with 2 clusters projected to the two axes that explain the most
                        model variance. Countries with high NMR are marked by dots, countries with
                        low NMR are marked by triangles.
                        Fig. 2. Bar plot showing the contributions of each indicator to the principal
                        components which account for the greatest proportion of variance for the
                        model. The red dotted line shows the expected contribution, which would be
                        a uniform contribution from each indicator.
                        Fig. 3. Clusters using PCA from just the indicators IB, SANI, WAT, SHP,
                        and LBW.
                        sacrifice 0.5% efficacy for a 58% increase in data. Using more
                        countries in our analysis will not only enable greater certainty
                        in the results but also demonstrates which indicators are most
                        important for all countries to decrease NMR, as is the goal of
                        this study.
                        The good clustering separability for the NMR classes implies the NMR data for each country can be explained by the
                        quantities of the indicators investigated.
