                    <h3 class="text-left">Project Overview</h3>
                    <p class="text-left">     
                        The effect of dust on precipitation at high latitudeshas  not  been  adequately  explored  as  most  of  this  research  hasbeen restricted to mid- and low-latitude regions. 
                        Even so, at theselower  latitudes  the  relationship  between  dust  and  precipitation still has not been distinctly established. The purpose of this studyis  to  act  as  a  
                        starting  point  for  understanding  the  role  dustplays  in  precipitation  processes  at  high  latitudes.  Knowledge of  the  effects  dust  can  have  on  precipitation  
                        will  allow  forbetter  prediction  and  forecasting  through  an  improvement  ofregional  and  global  climate  models.  In  order  to  investigate  thisrelationship, 
                        we  looked  at  instances  of  high-latitude  dust  and precipitation  amounts  specifically  in  regions  of  Alaska,  Icelandand  Patagonia. 
                        The  precipitation  data  were  separated  in  terms of  days  where  dust  was  present,  versus  absent  (binary  basis).Most  of  the  precipitation  averages  were  low 
                        with  the  highestprecipitation amounts seen only on days without dust. The datawere also separated into four specific days surrounding the dustevent  (4-day  basis);  the  
                        day  before  the  dust  event,  the  day  of,one day after and two days after. The day of and one day afterwere  limited  to  having  lower  levels  of  precipitation 
                        whereas  theday  before  and  two  days  after  exhibited  a  broader  range  ofprecipitation  levels,  which  included  the  highest  amounts.  
                        These initial  observations  indicated  more  of  a  negative  relationship between  the  high-latitude  dust  events  and  precipitation.  
                        Two classifications  of  precipitation  intensity  were  created  and  testedfor  the  purpose  of  this  study.  
                        After  which,  correlation  analyses(Chi-Square Test, Fisher’s Exact Test and Rank Correlations) and classification  modeling  (Decision  Tree  modeling)  were  applied.
                        The  p-values  from  the  correlation  analyses  were  less  than  0.05 suggesting  that  there  is  likely  a  statistically  significant  relationship  between  the  high-latitude 
                        dust  events  and  precipitation, and   this   relationship   again   appears   to   be   slightly   negative. The  classification  models  were  able  to  predict  the  precipitation amounts 
                        for  the  days  surrounding  the  dust  events  using  the two  classifications.  However,  they  were  not  specifically  able  to distinguish  between  each  of  the  categories  for  the 
                        classifications as  most  of  the  data  were  in  the  lower  categories.

                        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                    <h4> High latitude Dust Data & Precipitation Data:</h4>

                    <p>
                        The high-latitude dust data images were shared with Rensselaer
                        Polytechnic Institute by the NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT). It included
                        206 images of high-latitude dust which were produced as part of NASA’s Global Imagery Browse Service
                        (GIBS). These images were extracted in conjunction with their corresponding dates and bounding box coordinates in
                        Alaska, Iceland and Patagonia. The dates and coordinates were used to manually obtain the precipitation
                        data from NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GPM/main/index.html">Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Mission</a> . 
                        For days where there were multiple dust events
                        in the same general location, the bounding box for acquiring the precipitation data was chosen as the minimum extent
                        containing all of the dust events. The post-processing resulted in 112 unique dust events that were used in obtaining the
                        GPM data.
                        
                   

                    
                        <h4> Overall aim of the project: </h4>

                        <p>
                            The overall aim of this project is to add to the investigation into how the presence of dust affects the amounts of precipitation of a region and gain insights into a time line for how long the  effect, 
                            if  any,  can  be  observed.  This  study  also  looks  to predict  precipitation  amounts  based  on  the  days  surrounding the dust event, specifically the 4-day separation. As such, 
                            the precipitation was first classified based on intensity. 

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            In  order  to  optimize  the  model  to  achieve  the  goal  of splitting  the  data  into  four  separate  leaf  nodes  distinctive  of each  specific  day,  multiple  variations  of  the  Initial  Classi-fication 
                            were  tested.  This  included;  changing  the  limits  ofeach  of  the  classes,  removing  a  class,  that  is,  only  having
                            “Light”,  “Moderate”,  “Heavy”,  as  well  as,  adding  in  extraclasses such as “Trace” and “Very Light”. The most successful classification in terms of achieving the goal was an expanded classification of sorts in 
                            which the lower end of the spectrum, where  most  of  the  data  were  restricted  to,  was  broken  into two classes and the ranges for other categories were expanded shown in the Table below.  
                            The  preliminary  analysis  resulted  in  the  decision tree  model shown below,  splitting  the  data  into  3  groups;  “dayof” the dust event, the “day before” and the days after (“1 dayafter” and “2 days after”).

                        The relationship between dust and precipitation in the
                        high latitude regions of Alaska, Iceland and Patagonia was
                        investigated through multiple correlation analysis techniques
                        and decision tree modelling. Results from this study indicate
                        that when high-latitude dust is absent, observed precipitation
                        can increase. The high latitude regions exhibited lower levels
                        of precipitation regardless of the presence or absence of
                        dust, and heavier precipitation was only seen (as outliers)
                        in the absence of dust. Additionally, the correlation analyses
                        seem to suggest a statistically significant relationship between
                        high-latitude dust and precipitation with p-values less than
                        0.05. The relationship appears to be negative based on the
                        residuals from the Chi-Square Test as well as the correlation
                        coefficients from the rank correlations, which corresponds with
                        initial observations made during the exploratory data analysis.
