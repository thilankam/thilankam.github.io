                        Access to water is one of the fundamental human rights.
                        Clean water is an issue plaguing many countries worldwide and is one of the world’s largest health concerns.
                        The poor are those who suffer significantly from access
                        to improved water sources and often contract other infectious diseases from unsafe water. This paper examines how the AI community can further research into
                        clean water data that is available and investigate the
                        socio-economic factors that prevent some communities
                        from gaining access to safe water sources. Preliminary
                        and Exploratory Data Analysis were done on the UN
                        data to understand the patterns, relations, and trends between related variables. Key correlations were investigated between different socioeconomic factors such
                        as GDP, Corruption, and Infrastructure to understand
                        what has the greatest effect on access to improved water sources. To do so, visualizations were built using
                        Python and the Seaborn package, as well as using the
                        Pandas package to curate the data.
                       
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Over 1.1 billion people in the world lack access to a
                            general water source according to the World Wildlife Organization, 2020 report.
                            According to Worldwildlife.org, 2.7 billion people suffer
                            from water scarcity at least one month a year, and 2.4
                            billion people are victims to clean water inadequately.
                            These numbers have been on the rise and continue to be
                            as scientists predict that by 2025, over two-thirds of the
                            world’s population will face water shortage issues (World
                            Wildlife Organization 2020).

                    <p>
                        The UN provides datasets that they have collected as well
                        as datasets from related organizations like the WHO at <a href="data.un.org">UN Data Repository</a> 
                        . Other sites like <a href="ourworldindata.org">Our World in Data </a>  also has relevant data towards understanding the problems behind lack
                        of access to clean water. To understand basic correlations
                        and present ideas for the reader, a dataset with information on populations using improved water sources was explored(World Health Organization 2014). This dataset has
                        a percentage of a population using improved water source
                        for 192 countries, and further divides the percentages into
                        whether they live in rural or urban areas. The rural areas
                        are defined as areas not part of major metropolitan areas,
                        which are defined by population density and distance from
                        the metropolitan city, and the rural data reflects data collected on those areas. Similarly, the urban data reflects data
                        collected in areas part of major metropolitan areas. There is
                        also historical data ranging from 1990 up to 2012 for these
                        countries, giving ample data to explore and analyze.

                            The project workflow as shown in Figure 1, project starts with
                            obtaining the data from the sources, cleaning the data, and

                        <h3>Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA)</h3>
                        <p>
                            EDA was
                            done on the collected dataset to understand correlations
                            between GDP per capita on percentage of total population’s
                            access to improved water source, as well as understanding
                            the correlations between GDP and percentage of urban
                            populations and percentage of rural populations’ access to
                            the improved water sources.

                    <p>
                        Combining this initial dataset with other indicators
                        provided by the World Bank (The World Bank 2018, 2020)
                        resulted in variables measuring Government Effectiveness,
                        Overall Infrastructure, and the Corruption Perception
                        Index. The initial dataset ranged from 1990 to 2012, but
                        the World Bank dataset had data from 1995 to 2012. For
                        preliminary purposes, the following analyses were done
                        on data collected on the year 2012. Looking at only 124
                        countries in 2012, the following heatmap in Figure 6 to
                        investigate correlations was generated.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        we can see a strong blue color means a higher
                        correlation between the two variables. We see a medium to
                        a strong correlation between the corruption perception index
                        (Corruption Perceptions Index 2020) and percent of the rural
                        population with access. This can be perceived as certain rural populations not having access to improved water sources
                        because of a higher corruption perception index.
                        We can also observe that there is a strong relationship between government effectiveness and percentage value of rural population that has access to improved water sources,
                        which makes sense given that more effective governments
                        are able to provide water sources to all parts of the country.
                        There is a medium correlation between infrastructure rating and percentage of the total population with access to improved water sources. This could be because this infrastructure rating considers all infrastructure in the country, and it
                        may be more prudent just to observe water-related infrastructure, like drainage basins, sewers, reservoirs, etc.

                    <p> 
                        The AI community can help leverage this data and turn it
                        into a usable tool for governments and relief organizations
                        by helping them predict where resources must be allocated
                        first to enhance access to improved water sources. Using it
                        as a model to predict where clean water sources will deplete given trends in GDP, infrastructure, and other socioeconomic 
                        factors would be very useful as several scholars assert that by 2025, two-thirds of the world’s population will
                        face water shortage.(World Wildlife Organization 2020).

                    </p>

                    

                    <p>
                        Additionally, models can be used to investigate where water quality is low. With machines and water filters that continuously 
                        check whether the water is safe to drink or not,
                        a data collection feature could be added and could provide
                        data for data scientists to use in narrowing down where the
                        water contamination is happening. Prototypes of devices that
                        can detect whether water quality is low and can report the
                        data to a database exist, and could be used for this application.
                        By using machine learning techniques and neural networks, this existing data coupled with other socio-economic
                        datasets can be used for the further analysis and develop
                        prediction models. Lack of clean water leads to many
                        infectious diseases, such as deadly diarrheal diseases,
                        cholera, and typhoid, and by using a model to see where
                        there is no clean water available, medical professionals can
                        help try to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in those
                        areas utilizing those models. Stakeholders for this type
                        of application would be public policy experts, healthcare
                        professionals, and infrastructure professionals who could
                        help provide data and insights regarding what sort of
                        socioeconomic factors are most prevalent in prohibiting
                        access to clean water.

                    <p>This paper presents a preliminary understanding of what
                        could be done to collect and explore the data to help solve
                        access to improved water sources. Looking at correlations
                        between key indicators and populations with access to water
                        sources provides a basic understanding of what features to
                        use in future models. Additionally, looking at rural populations over urban populations may be more productive since
                        urban populations tend to be well developed and have good
                        water sources. We plan to use the insights gained from this
                        initial analysis to test out different hypotheses and research
                        questions in the future. </p>
